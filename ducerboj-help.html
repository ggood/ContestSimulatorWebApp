<div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big>Ducerboj Help</big></big></big><br></div><br>Ducerboj<sup>*</sup> is a web app that sends amateur radio callsigns in each side of the stereo mix. You get points by correctly copying the callsigns you hear, and you get bonus points by alternating between the left and right channels.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Layout</span><br><br>The app has two logging text fields, one for the left channel and one for the right channel. You switch between the inputs by pressing the Tab key. The selected logging field will change its background color to indicate that it is active.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Starting the app</span><br><br>Click the Start button. You should hear one or more stations calling in each ear. When you can copy one of the stations, use the tab key to select the left or right logging text field and type the callsign.<br><br>The log window will show you the callsign you typed, and will indicate if it was correct or not. You get one point if the callsign is correct, but you get 5 points if the last callsign you copied was from the other simulated radio. That is, if you can keep switching between your left and right ears, you'll get more points.<br><br>If a station keeps calling you and you don't copy the callsign, it will eventually give up and a new station will take its place. You can click the Reset button for the left or right radios to cause a new station to call you. This is useful if you just can't copy the current callsign and want to try a new one.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stopping the app</span><br><br>Click the Stop button<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Feedback</span><br><br>This is just a little hack I made to see if it's possible to build contest simulator apps using the web audio api built into modern web browsers. It's provided without support, but if you'd like to send me feedback, you can reach me at km6i [at] arrl [dot] net.<br><br><br><br>"*Ducerboj" comes from the Esperanto "du cerboj" which means "two brains".
