Open Issues:

- A station should just send output to a provided destination. That way,
I can run all the DX stations output into a mixer, and then the output
of that mixer goes into a separate two-channel mixer with inputs (1) all
stations and (2) my station. That way it's easier to mute the other stations.
(Done, I think)

- Since I queue up all the dots and dashes for the entire message coming
from a station, I need a way to abort all the scheduled output, to
simulate a station hearing a call and stopping.

  Tone Generator --- Keying Envelope and Gain (Gain)

  Noise source generates random waveform for playback

  QRN bursts are a louder noise waveform with a gain
  control that is enabled or disabled by the main code.
